If there are - in the cells, then that column is centered for this 2004/ data.
 tt = readLines("Notes"); tt = grep("^[0-9]|T", tt, value = TRUE); n =sapply(strsplit(tt, " "), `[`, 1); n = n[!is.na(n) & n != ""]; n = as.integer(gsub("^T", "", n))


T22 - ERROR

T14 - footer line is broken into 2. Slight gap after Madera column.

Problems/Issues - 18 at present
T15 - problems.  o = getColumnData("T15")
T19  presence of many -  make it look as if there are two columns within the  same area.  This is because we are not using the cols.mid for this
T26  
T56
T55
T39
T36
T34 - need to be using the cols.mid not just cols.left.
T35 -  has some -

T01 - content is split across lines within a cell.
      We do have horizontal lines separating the rows!
      The column cutting points are wrong. Not getting column 2 by itself but mixing with col 3.
      Same with col 4 & 5

T02 - too few boxes on the page to exceed the threshold for findCols.  So findCols() has to adapt dynamically to the number of boxes.
       Also missing values of the form - and so the rankings for those rows are entirely absent (i.e. the number within the ( ) in the next "column")
T03 - similar to T02
T04 - similar to T02
T05 - similar to T02

T16 - some text mixed between adjacent columns Type and Parentage
  The column split is putting two for the shor column.

T20 - small columns mixing with adjacent.
   It is now the "20 Entries" at the bottom by itself.
   Here we can see it is just a summary. But we could just add an NA to each of the other columns.
   The fourth column has a lot of missing values.
   If we know we have the columns correct, we could just fill these in.
    Alternatively, look at each row and figure out the number of cells and fill in accordingly (easier said than done).

T40  - small column again #3
T06 - small columns bleeding into others/vice-versa.

T13 - NO - not same as T12 anymore
