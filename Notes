If there are - in the cells, then that column is centered for this 2004/ data.
 tt = readLines("Notes"); tt = grep("^[0-9]|T", tt, value = TRUE); n =sapply(strsplit(tt, " "), `[`, 1); n = n[!is.na(n) & n != ""]; n = as.integer(gsub("^T", "", n))


Get the column headers!

T14 - footer line is broken into 2. Slight gap after Madera column.
  Doesn't discard the header.  But this is because of the weird line in the footer.

Problems/Issues - 18 at present
T15 - problems.  o = getColumnData("T15")
T19  presence of many -  make it look as if there are two columns within the  same area.  This is because we are not using the cols.mid for this
T26  
T56
T55
T39
T36
T34 - need to be using the cols.mid not just cols.left.
T35 -  has some -

T01 - content is split across lines within a cell.
      We do have horizontal lines separating the rows!
      The column cutting points are wrong. Not getting column 2 by itself but mixing with col 3.
      Same with col 4 & 5

T02 - too few boxes on the page to exceed the threshold for findCols.  So findCols() has to adapt dynamically to the number of boxes.
       Also missing values of the form - and so the rankings for those rows are entirely absent (i.e. the number within the ( ) in the next "column")
T03 - similar to T02
T04 - similar to T02
T05 - similar to T02

T16 - some text mixed between adjacent columns Type and Parentage
  The column split is putting two for the shor column.


T06 - small columns bleeding into others/vice-versa.

T13 - NO - not same as T12 anymore

Problems we are beginning to know about

T40  -                               previous: small column again #3
   Okay now, but there is a missing value in the 4th column, in the middle.

T20 - small columns mixing with adjacent.
    Everything is fine except the fourth column has a lot of missing values.
    If we know we have the columns correct, we could just fill these in.
    Alternatively, look at each row and figure out the number of cells and fill in accordingly (easier said than done).
   [Done] It is now the "20 Entries" at the bottom by itself.
        Here we can see it is just a summary. But we could just add an NA to each of the other columns.



---------
Returns as List

T23 - getting confused with the  number (rank) and the - as one or two columns and missing values induced 
        The - is being intrepreted in the adjaced column and so no values in the cells of the number/value column.
        In the last "column" - number and rank, the terms are being mixed so much longer.
   Need to handle the - character specially.

T24 - list CommonWheat... ok
   2 centered columns at the end.

T38 - 
   Seems like we might make this work if the split between columns isn't just the  mid point between the two columns
   but the right value + 1  of all the cells in the previous columns.

38  two columns in the result are split which would make one column.

T44 - list 
T43 - list
T54 -  one column broken into 2. -midpoint issue versus right of the last group should do this.
