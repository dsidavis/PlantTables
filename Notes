If there are - in the cells, then that column is centered for this 2004/ data.
 tt = readLines("Notes"); tt = grep("^[0-9]|T", tt, value = TRUE); n =sapply(strsplit(tt, " "), `[`, 1); n = n[!is.na(n) & n != ""]; n = as.integer(gsub("^T", "", n))


Problems/Issues - 18 at present
T15 - problems.  o = getColumnData("T15")
T19  presence of many -  make it look as if there are two columns within the  same area.  This is because we are not using the cols.mid for this
T26  
T56
T55
T39
T36
T34 - need to be using the cols.mid not just cols.left.
T35 -  has some -

T01 - content is split across lines within a cell.
      We do have horizontal lines separating the rows!
      The column cutting points are wrong. Not getting column 2 by itself but mixing with col 3.
      Same with col 4 & 5

T02 - too few boxes on the page to exceed the threshold for findCols.
T03 - similar to T02
T04 - similar to T02
T05 - similar to T02

T16 - some text mixed between adjacent columns Type and Parentage
T20 - small columns mixing with adjacent.
