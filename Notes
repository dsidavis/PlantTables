If there are - in the cells, then that column is centered for this 2004/ data.
 tt = readLines("Notes"); tt = grep("^[0-9]|T", tt, value = TRUE); n =sapply(strsplit(tt, " "), `[`, 1); n = n[!is.na(n) & n != ""]; n = as.integer(gsub("^T", "", n))


[done] recombine cells within a column that are on the same line.
This means group by bottom + 5. (Deal with the subscripts).

[done] Find lines and then identify missing cells.


Because of filling in the missing cells, we are getting data frames which are not correct.

When determining the `splits` locations, try to back up to the rightmost value in the previous column.


Get the column headers!

  0   0   0   0   0 

  All checked. Okay.




T16
 currently breaking the Type column into 2 with lots of NAs.
 The subscript on the  F_6Colter is one issue causing problems for the guessCells().
  We want to recombine these values with a very similar value for bottom that cannot be  on the next line into a single cell.
  mergeHorizontalBoxes assumes we have already grouped them. So we need to group by bottom and the average distance.  Could cause problems if lots of subscripts.
   But could check ignore those that are all within n (e.g. 4) units of another bottom.
   

T05 T14 & 15. 
  For Mark's data, what if we add a cell when there is a - to the left of it.  
  We need to know that these columns are ranks.  So need to look at others.

  What if we just remove the rows that look like ranks!!!!!


? The - values sometimes have a different bottom than the others. T05  STAB113
    Should pdftohtml output the numeric values, not integers.


If there are only n columns that has fewer cells, treat this as a missing value




Note:  T35 and T36 have the same pattern of where NAs are located. Seems reasonable, but just mentioning.



T14 - footer line is broken into 2. Slight gap after Madera column.
  Doesn't discard the header.  But this is because of the weird line in the footer.

T15 - lots of - in the table.
------


Problems/Issues - 18 at present
T19  presence of many -  make it look as if there are two columns within the  same area.  This is because we are not using the cols.mid for this
T39
T34 - need to be using the cols.mid not just cols.left.
  1 column split into 2.

T01 - content is split across lines within a cell.
      We do have horizontal lines separating the rows!
      The column cutting points are wrong. Not getting column 2 by itself but mixing with col 3.
      Same with col 4 & 5

T02 - too few boxes on the page to exceed the threshold for findCols.  So findCols() has to adapt dynamically to the number of boxes.
       Also missing values of the form - and so the rankings for those rows are entirely absent (i.e. the number within the ( ) in the next "column")
T03 - similar to T02
T04 - similar to T02
T05 - similar to T02

T16 - some text mixed between adjacent columns Type and Parentage
  The column split is putting two for the shor column.
  Subscripts as in T06
   So the column with 45 would come to 43. There are 3 columns with 43, and 2 with 16 & 27 to make up the 43.


T13 - one column  split into two.

---------------
Problems we are beginning to know about

T40  -                               previous: small column again #3
   Okay now, but there is a missing value in the 4th column, in the middle.

T20 - Missing values small columns mixing with adjacent.
    Everything is fine except the fourth column has a lot of missing values.
    If we know we have the columns correct, we could just fill these in.
    Alternatively, look at each row and figure out the number of cells and fill in accordingly (easier said than done).
   [Done] It is now the "20 Entries" at the bottom by itself.
        Here we can see it is just a summary. But we could just add an NA to each of the other columns.



---------
Returns as List


T38 - 
   Seems like we might make this work if the split between columns isn't just the  mid point between the two columns
   but the right value + 1  of all the cells in the previous columns.
 38  two columns in the result are split which would make one column.

    Col 15 Mix Pk
    These are split based on 4 characters and  5 characters
    3.00 versus 15.00 
    We need to be right justified here.

T43 - list
20
23
T34
35
36
38 - 19 columns with same length, 2 that are split to make up the other column.
    o[sapply(o, length) < 34]
     right aligned.
39 - missing values (-)	

40 - one column has one less value.  There is a missing value in this column.
43 - - and values are split.

53, 54, 55, 56

"T48" "T49" "T50" "T51" "T52"


T23 -  Too few cells in the columns with missing ranks so that the threshold doesn't add another column split.
     French accent in Decor that is not coming out from pdftohtml properly.
 
    getting confused with the  number (rank) and the - as one or two columns and missing values induced 
        The - is being intrepreted in the adjaced column and so no values in the cells of the number/value column.
        In the last "column" - number and rank, the terms are being mixed so much longer.
   Need to handle the - character specially.




Check T24 & 44 when we fix mergeHorizontalBoxes to handle the subscripts.
T24 - works with simple mergeHorizontalBoxes, i.e. when we only check bottoms are the same.  
     one column has two cells each with 2 boxes that have no space between them.  "a male"
 ***  Merge  these boxes together.
   2 centered columns at the end.
   4 cells need to be merged into 2 cells as they are exactly adjacent  (right of one has same value as left of the next one)

44 - same as 24 - adjacent cells need to be merged. But they are not exactly adjacent. 
      Need to merge these afterwards given that they have the same bottom/top and are in the same column.


T54 -  one column broken into 2. -midpoint issue versus right of the last group should do this.


T06 -  Missing value in the 4th column.
   [Fixed] In column 4, we have odd boxes.  F_6, i.e. F subscript 6 or 7.  This makes multiple boxes.
     We need to recombine these.  e.g. F7 CMB85A

T21 - df now.   TABLE 21 had a space before it.
T22 - df
T07 - df

T09 - df
T10 - df

T12 - df
T17 - df
T18 - df
T30 - okay
T37 - after accounting for mean.
