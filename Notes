T15 - problems.  o = getColumnData("T15")

T01 - content is split across lines within a cell.
      We do have horizontal lines separating the rows!
      The column cutting points are wrong. Not getting column 2 by itself but mixing with col 3.
      Same with col 4 & 5

T02 - too few boxes on the page to exceed the threshold for findCols.
T03 - similar to T02
T04 - similar to T02
T05 - similar to T02
